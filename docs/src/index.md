# LagrangianDescriptors.jl documentation

The dynamics of evolutionary systems can be quite intricate. The method of **Lagrangian Descriptors** helps to visualize the complicate behavior of such systems. In a recent article, Wiggins and and García-Garrido call it *painting the phase portrait* (of a dynamical system) (see [S. Wiggins and V. J. García-Garrido, Painting the Phase Portrait of a Dynamical System with the Computational Tool of Lagrangian Descriptors (AMS Notices, June/July 2022)](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202206/noti2489/noti2489.html?adat=June/July%202022&trk=2489&galt=none&cat=feature&pdfissue=202206&pdffile=rnoti-p936.pdf).

The method is akin to droping colored ink in a fluid flow and seeing the dye being transported to reveal the flow patterns, except that the color don't get diffused as in a real fluid.

The image below, for instance, shows the dynamics of a periodically-forced Duffing equation, with a particular combination of parameters and near time $t=0$:
